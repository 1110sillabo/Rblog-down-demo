Test for a new blog, needed to have something more dynamic and usable than actual blog + Medium.

Thanks [Alison](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/)!

Oh, I wrote [that book on Digital Humanities]() and before learning about blogdown, I started a website over at www.thegui.eu.

# Now for the Nice Yihui's Sample...


This is a "hello world" example website for the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).
