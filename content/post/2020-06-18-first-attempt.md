I use to have a website with a slightly complex and hard to manage blog.

I discovered blogdown and then thought, "ok, I need to try that". I first used blogdown to build local pages for presentations. Next step was deploy with Netlify.

[This post by Alison helpe a lot](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/) as did the [blogdown dedicated page](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html) and some of the [Netlify docs](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/).

There are still issues with .eu domains, but I'll find a way.
