I wrote [this blogpost on using R blogdown in academia](https://codeburst.io/r-blogdown-websites-for-academics-8c381b8372ac).

It turns out the post was read but still it was not enough to help putting something out. So I remembered I had a simple demo project out for an R blog down example. And here it is.

A few files, some custom links and a post. Deployed on Netlify as Yihui suggests.
